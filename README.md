JavaPathFindingApp
==================

Java GUI application that demonstrates the A* path finding algorithm.

The application contains the algorithm used for pathing finding for an AI component across a grid-based layout. 
This algorithm, specifically known as the A* algorithm, allows the AI component to find a target location on the 
grid using the shortest path possible.  The algorithm robust enough to operate when obstacles are placed between 
the AI component and the target location.

To use the application, the user must select the "Player Marker" button then place a location on the grid by 
selecting a square panel displayed.  Then the user must designate the AI location by selecting the "Monster Marker"
button and its location on the grid.  By selecting the "Obstacles" button, the user can then disable square panels 
on the grid to restrict the AI from traversing.  Finally, the user can either select to step through the path 
finding procedure by selecting the "Step" button, or see the final path for the AI to traverse by selecting the 
"Full Path" button.
